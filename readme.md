# Image Processing with OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates basic image processing using the OpenCV library. It loads an image, performs color space conversions, and displays the original and processed images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (you can install it using `pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Use

1. Create a folder named "image_processing" in the same directory as your script.

2. Place the image you want to process inside the "image_processing" folder. Ensure that the image is named "mario.png or change in the code."

3. Run the script `main.py`.

4. The script will load the image, convert it to different color spaces (RGB and grayscale), and display the original and processed images using OpenCV's `imshow` function.

5. Close the image windows by pressing any key.

## Example

Suppose you have an image named "mario.png" in the "image_processing" folder.

After running the script, it will display the following images:
- The original image
- The RGB color space conversion
- The grayscale image
- The YCrCb to BGR color space conversion
